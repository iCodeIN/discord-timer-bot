A Discord timer bot, that uses ffmpeg to play a sound when the time is up! 

Code can be hosted locally on linux or on a linux server.

*Use as a starting reference for creating your own :) !*

*Not robust code, will break if kicked while playing sound or if multiple timers are set at the same time :)*
